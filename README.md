# Introduction-and-Data-Wrangling-Summary-using-python
In this section, you will learn how to approach data acquisition in various ways, and obtain necessary insights from a dataset. By the end of this lab, you will successfully load the data into Jupyter Notebook, and gain some fundamental insights via Pandas Library.

Data Acquisition
In our case, the Automobile Dataset is an online source, and it is in CSV (comma separated value) format. Let's use this dataset as an example to practice data reading.
data source: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/autos/imports-85.data
data type: csv
The Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a data frame; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in Pandas Library so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.

# Data wrangling 
Data Wrangling involves processing the data in various formats like - merging, grouping, concatenating etc. for the purpose of analysing or getting them ready to be used with another set of data. Python has built-in features to apply these wrangling methods to various data sets to achieve the analytical goal. More often than not, you find yourself dealing with a lot of data, which is of no use to you in its raw form. The process of cleaning the data enough to input to the analytical algorithm is known as Data Wrangling. It is also referred to as Data Munging. In this chapter we will look at few examples describing these methods.
